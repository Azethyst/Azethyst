### I'm Brix Ian Marcellana, a Computer Engineering Student

From deconstructing to reconstructing toys and electronic devices, engineering was a passion that I enjoyed dearly. Learning software drove my dream even further, as more options grew certain ideas felt more achievable. Computer Engineering to me is more than just a profession, it solves problems, saves lives, and connects people. It allows me to bring my ambitious ideas into reality. As technology becomes increasingly more complex and popular, this allows me the opportunity to expand my skill set and apply it to the world. I am extremely excited about working with people in the field, as I try to learn and improve upon my work. I am thrilled in joining the collaborative process in ensuring a final product that can dominate the competition.
